# Developer Portfolio

**Portfolio template inspired from VSCode UI that can be use by any developers built from Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS.**

This portfolio is free of use and I only request is to not change my **Name** in the `footer` section. This means that I only take the credit for who built this free portfolio.

## ‚òï Buy me a coffee

You can buy me a coffee if you like my work and wish to thank me or inspire me to do more.
Please donate whatever you feel comfortable doing to my coffee fund.
The coffee will give me the motivation to work even harder.

I appreciate it. Thank you so much!
